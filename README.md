# dylanfuncs

Here are some functions that I use periodically wrapped up into a neat box. You can download the dylanfuncs folder and then run devtools::document('path/to/dylanfuncs') to load them into your R session. Note that there's a good amount of junk in there i.e., functions you'll never see and never use. 

### Update 07/31/2023:

I added a few new functions, namely makePie(), makeMediDiagram(), pull_important_medvals(). Still new to this so I added a summary/description to the new commit called "Mediation and pie funcs" thinking that it would just describe the update. Instead, it renamed the folder. But the folder is not just the mediation and pie funcs... one day I'll get the hang of this..

### Update 02/20/2026:
tbh I'm not sure what is different between the last version and this one. uhh. I think since 2023 I've become better at commenting my code and being descriptive in the documentation. So if the documentation is good, it's probably newer. If it's bad, it's probably old (and also not maintained, so just b careful)
