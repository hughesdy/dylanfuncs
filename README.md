# dylanfuncs

Here are some functions that I use periodically wrapped up into a neat box. You can download the dylanfuncs folder and then run devtools::document('path/to/dylanfuncs') to load them into your R session. Note that there's a good amount of junk in there i.e., functions you'll never see and never use.
