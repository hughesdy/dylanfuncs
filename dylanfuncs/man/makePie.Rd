\usage{
makePie(data, title, print = F, showLegend = F, grabLegend = F, labelSize = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{vector to be pie'd}

\item{print}{if True, then the pie chart will be printed. The default is false so that it is compatible with gridExtra later on and won't make your Rmd messy. Defaults to FALSE}

\item{showLegend}{if True, a legend will be plotted. Default is FALSE to make things cleaner in Rmd when you grid your pies. Defaults to FALSE}

\item{grabLegend}{Relevant for grid.arrange function. If True, a legend will be grabbed to be fed into gridExtra functions later. Again this is FALSE to be more compatible with gridExtra. If you want to make a omni-legend for your grid plots, then you can change the argument to TRUE and the function will output a legend AND the pie chart as two separate objects}

\item{labelSize}{Sets the size of labels on pie chart. Defaults to 6.}

This function makes a pie chart out of data you feed it! Compatible with loopPieThroughYears()
